# WeatherApp
This is a weather app created on Python GUI using tkinter. \n
It uses all the required tools to create a GUI application with a label, textfield and a Button which uses an API key from a weather website to return values of city with their weather which is then used to display on the interface along with an icon of the weather. \n
The only non-added functionality is there is no icon created using pyinstaller since my mac does not create one for now but will be updated in the near future.
